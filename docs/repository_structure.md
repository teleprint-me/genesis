In that case, it's a great idea to include beginner-friendly neural network architectures as well. The `templates` directory can also include simpler architectures like the Tiny Neural Network you mentioned. This way, beginners can easily start with these simpler models and gradually progress towards more complex architectures as they gain more experience.

We can modify the directory structure to include the Tiny Neural Network:

```sh
genesis
├── app.py
├── __init__.py
├── models
│   ├── templates
│   │   ├── ff.py
│   │   ├── cnn.py
│   │   ├── rnn.py
│   │   ├── transformer.py
│   │   ├── gpt.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── hugging_face.py
│   ├── openai_api.py
│   ├── eleven_labs_api.py
│   ├── local_models.py
│   ├── llama_cpp.py
│   ├── langchain.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── tools
│   ├── training.py
│   ├── evaluation.py
│   ├── dataset_management.py
│   ├── text_generation.py
│   ├── developer_tools.py
│   ├── debug_tools.py
│   ├── configuration.py
│   ├── helpers.py
│   └── __init__.py
├── ui
│   ├── main_window.py
│   ├── model_view.py
│   ├── editor_view.py
│   ├── panels.py
│   ├── dialogs.py
│   ├── menu_bar
│   │   ├── file_menu.py
│   │   ├── edit_menu.py
│   │   ├── view_menu.py
│   │   ├── tools_menu.py
│   │   ├── model_menu.py
│   │   ├── help_menu.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── __init__.py
```

Now, the `templates` directory contains the Tiny Neural Network, making it easier for beginners to get started with neural networks using the Genesis project.

Besides feed-forward networks, other basic types of neural networks include:

1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Primarily used for image processing, pattern recognition, and computer vision tasks. They consist of convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Designed for processing sequential data, RNNs are commonly used in natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. They contain loops that allow information to persist, which makes them suitable for handling sequences.

3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: A special type of RNN that is designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs. LSTMs are used in various sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and text generation.

4. Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): Another type of RNN, GRUs are similar to LSTMs but have a simpler architecture. They are used in similar applications, such as natural language processing and speech recognition.

These are some of the fundamental types of neural networks, but there are many other architectures and variants available for specific use cases.
