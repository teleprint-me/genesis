    - About Genesis

In this updated outline, I added an "Editor" menu with options for creating and closing text editor instances, changing syntax and theme, toggling line numbers and word wrap, and folding/unfolding code blocks. The File menu has also been updated to include options for handling files within the text editor. With these additions, developers can efficiently use Genesis as an all-in-one tool for model interactions.
