# Genesis

Genesis is a versatile user interface for creating, training, and interacting with AI models. The primary focus is on providing an easy-to-use environment for developers and users to work with various AI models, such as those from Hugging Face, OpenAI API, Eleven Labs API, and local models.

This project is in its infancy and has a long development journey ahead. I appreciate your support, suggestions, and contributions as I continue to develop Genesis.

This project and its contents were created with the assistance of OpenAI's GPT-4.

## Features

-   Access Hugging Face models directly within the application
-   Interface with OpenAI API
-   Access Eleven Labs API
-   Run local models for building from scratch or inference
-   Simplified interactions with LLMs (Large Language Models) and other AI models
-   Support for langchain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models
-   Integration with llama.cpp and its Python bindings, enabling optimized model inference on a variety of platforms and models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Arch Linux (other platforms may work but are not officially supported at this time)
-   VS Code
-   Poetry
-   Black
-   Flake8
-   pytest (for running unit tests)

### Installation

_TODO: Add installation instructions_

## Development

Genesis is built using DearPyGui, a powerful Python GUI framework. As you work on the project, please ensure that you:

-   Keep the GUI and core functionality separate for easier unit testing
-   Write unit tests for non-GUI components
-   Test the GUI-specific parts manually or with a dedicated GUI testing framework if necessary

_TODO: Add more development guidelines and instructions_

## Contributing
